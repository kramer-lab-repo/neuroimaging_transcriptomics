## Overview
This repository presents a neuroimaging transcriptomics pipeline developed for identifying gene expression patterns associated with the myelin water fraction (MWF) measure.

## Data Sources
### Neuroimaging Data
Myelin water imaging data was acquired from a healthy adult brain atlas (n=50, mean age=25 years) using the GRASE sequence. MWF was extracted from 5 ROI masks parcellated from the Johns Hopkins Univeristy atlas. The parcellation masks are available upon request.
### Transcriptomic Data
Transcriptomic data was obtained from the Allen Human Brain Atlas microarray dataset: https://human.brain-map.org/.

## Manuscript Abstract (Published in Molecular Brain)
Identifying sensitive and specific measures that can quantify myelin are instrumental in characterizing microstructural changes in neurological conditions. Neuroimaging transcriptomics is emerging as a valuable technique in this regard, offering insights into the molecular basis of promising candidates for myelin quantification, such as myelin water fraction (MWF). We aimed to demonstrate the utility of neuroimaging transcriptomics by validating MWF as a myelin measure. We utilized data from a normative MWF brain atlas, comprised of 50 healthy subjects (mean age = 25 years, range = 17–42 years) scanned at 3 Tesla. Magnetic resonance imaging data included myelin water imaging to extract MWF and T1 anatomical scans for image registration and segmentation. We investigated the inter-regional distributions of gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas in conjunction with inter-regional MWF distribution patterns. Pearson correlations were used to identify genes with expression profiles mirroring MWF. The Single Cell Type Atlas from the Human Protein Atlas was leveraged to classify genes into gene sets with high cell type specificity, and a control gene set with low cell type specificity. Then, we compared the Pearson correlation coefficients for each gene set to determine if cell type-specific gene expression signatures correlate with MWF. Pearson correlation coefficients between MWF and gene expression for oligodendrocytes and adipocytes were significantly higher than for the control gene set, whereas correlations between MWF and inhibitory/excitatory neurons were significantly lower. Our approach in integrating transcriptomics with neuroimaging measures supports an emerging technique for understanding and validating MRI-derived markers such as MWF.
