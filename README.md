# Neuroimaging Transcriptomics

## Overview
This repository presents a neuroimaging transcriptomics pipeline developed for identifying gene expression patterns associated with the myelin water fraction (MWF) measure.

## Data Sources
### Neuroimaging Data
Myelin water imaging data was acquired from a healthy adult brain atlas (n=50, mean age=25 years) using the GRASE sequence. MWF was extracted from 5 ROI masks parcellated from the Johns Hopkins Univeristy atlas. The parcellation masks are available upon request.
### Transcriptomic Data
Transcriptomic data was obtained from the Allen Human Brain Atlas microarray dataset: https://human.brain-map.org/.
